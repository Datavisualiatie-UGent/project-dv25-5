<p>In this project, we aim to uncover patterns related to alcohol consumption in the United States. We distinguish five consumption groups, ranging from people who never drink to those who consume alcohol daily. Our analysis will focus on two main aspects: the demographics associated with drinking habits and the correlations between alcohol consumption and factors such as BMI, migraines, and dietary habits.

<p>The dataset comes from the American Gut Project, a big project designed to understand the human microbiome and its relationship to lifestyle and health. Although the dataset includes international responses and a wide range of variables, we chose to focus specifically on alcohol consumption within the United States. This decision was based on two factors: the majority of observations came from U.S. participants, and alcohol use emerged as one of the most intriguing variables for further exploration.</p>
