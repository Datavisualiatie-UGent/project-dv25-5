  <h2>The dataset</h2>
  <p>todo: add description of the dataset, and explain choice for focus on alcohol consumption, maybe add some numbers about stuff in the dataset</p>
</div>

<p>In this project, we aim to uncover patterns related to alcohol consumption in the United States. We distinguish five consumption groups, ranging from people who never drink to those who consume alcohol daily. Our analysis will focus on two main aspects: the demographics associated with drinking habits and the correlations between alcohol consumption and factors such as BMI, migraines, and dietary habits.</p>
